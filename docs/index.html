  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Annie.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a current undergrad at Duke University (2018), where I double major in CS and Statistics. Starting in August, I&rsquo;ll be joining Apple as a Research Engineer on their Apple Media Products Analytics team.</p>

<p>Selected to work alongside Duke Medical School and BME faculty to better understand the potential risks associated with healthcare centers, environmental microbes, and infectious diseases through mapping the distribution of antibiotic-resistance genes across the Duke campus. Led the computational team in developing tools for data analysis and dissemination. Personally set up data pipeline and developed project <a href="https://bluedevilresistome.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank"> website </a> .</p>

<h3 id="protostar-2017-2018">ProtoStar (2017-2018)</h3>

<p>Assisting Duke CS and Statistics faculty in developing an interactive tool that will improve online big data database query performance analysis through the use of large-scale, multi-level, directed acyclic dependency graphs. Specifically, researching the use of probabilistic reasoning to define an intelligent method of large-scale data-stream collection and analysis.</p>

<h3 id="data-2015">Data+ (2015)</h3>

<p>Selected by the Information Initiative at Duke (i.i.D.) to research risk behavior with the Duke Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Applied machine learning algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and k-means to predict individual risk behavior preference, culminating in a predictive model 40% more accurate than previously available models.</p>
