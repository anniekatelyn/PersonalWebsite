  <h1>About</h1>
  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Annie.</p>
<p>I currently live in New York City and work as a data engineer on the artist facing platform at Spotify (i.e. I code and usually it works). I did my undergrad at Duke University, where I earned a double B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics. I&rsquo;m a self proclaimed hummus aficionado, bagel snob, and future proprietor of a cauliflower (or donut, I haven&rsquo;t decided yet) farm.</p>

  <h3 id="a-hrefhttpsbassconnectionsdukeeduproject-teamsblue-devil-resistome-project-2017-2018-target_blankblue-devil-resistomea"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blue Devil Resistome<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h3>
<p>Selected to work alongside Duke Medical School and BME faculty to better understand the potential risks associated with healthcare centers, environmental microbes, and infectious diseases through mapping the distribution of antibiotic-resistance genes across the Duke campus. Led the computational team in developing tools for data analysis and dissemination. Built data pipeline and developed project website.</p>
<h3 id="protostar">ProtoStar</h3>
<p>Assisted Duke CS and Statistics faculty in developing an interactive tool that improves online big data database query performance analysis through the use of large-scale, multi-level, directed acyclic dependency graphs. Specifically, researched the use of probabilistic reasoning to define an intelligent method of large-scale data-stream collection and analysis.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data+</h3>
<p>Selected by the Information Initiative at Duke (i.i.D.) to research risk behavior with the Duke Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Applied machine learning algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and k-means to predict individual risk behavior preference, culminating in a predictive model 40% more accurate than previously available models.</p>
