Hi, I'm Annie.

I'm a recent graduate of the Duke University Class of 2018, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Statistical Science. Since then, I've moved to California, and I currently work at Apple as a Research Engineer on the Apple Media Products Analytics Engineering team. 

<b> Highlights: </b> hummus aficionado, bagel snob, future proprietor of a cauliflower farm.
