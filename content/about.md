Hi, I'm Annie.

I currently live in New York City and work as a data engineer on the artist facing platform at Spotify (i.e. I code and usually it works). I did my undergrad at Duke University, where I earned a double B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm a self proclaimed hummus aficionado, bagel snob, and future proprietor of a cauliflower (or donut, I haven't decided yet) farm.
